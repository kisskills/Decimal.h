# Decimal.h

## General info 

Implementation of `decimal` value type in C language. This type represents 96-bit signed real number featuring opratinons without floating point imprecision. The library also provides an API for working with this type.

## Goal & requirements

In this project our task was to implement `decimal` type, that is 96-bit signed real number, and provide an API for working with it.

This type may be used instead of `IEEE 754` floats for calculations where floating point imprecision is unacceptable, for example, in financial transactions. 

`Decimal` also may be used as an analogue to Java `BigInteger` or 'BigInt' in JavaScript for scientific calculations.
